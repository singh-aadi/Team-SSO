# ü§ñ Gemini AI Prompt System - How It Works

## üìã The Complete Flow

### 1. PDF Upload
```
User uploads PDF ‚Üí Express/Multer saves to /uploads ‚Üí Triggers analysis
```

### 2. Text Extraction
```javascript
// Uses pdf-parse library
const extractedText = await extractTextFromPDF(pdfBuffer);
// Example output: "Slide 1: Problem Statement\nWe're solving X problem..."
```

### 3. Gemini AI Prompt (THE MAGIC!)

Here's the **EXACT PROMPT** sent to Gemini Pro:

```
You are an expert VC analyst evaluating startup pitch decks. 
Analyze the following pitch deck for [Company Name] and provide detailed, actionable feedback.

PITCH DECK CONTENT:
[Full extracted PDF text - could be 1000-5000 words]

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format (be strict about the format):

{
  "overallAnalysis": {
    "problemScore": <number 0-100>,
    "solutionScore": <number 0-100>,
    "marketScore": <number 0-100>,
    "tractionScore": <number 0-100>,
    "teamScore": <number 0-100>,
    "financialsScore": <number 0-100>,
    "overallScore": <number 0-100>,
    "strengths": [<3 key strengths as strings>],
    "weaknesses": [<3 areas to improve as strings>],
    "keyInsights": [<3 critical insights as strings>],
    "recommendation": "<One paragraph investment recommendation>"
  },
  "sectionAnalysis": [
    {
      "sectionName": "Problem",
      "sectionScore": <number 0-100>,
      "feedback": "<2-3 sentences about this section>",
      "strengths": [<2 specific strengths>],
      "improvements": [<2 specific improvements>]
    },
    ... (5 more sections: Solution, Market, Traction, Team, Financials)
  ]
}

SCORING CRITERIA:
- Problem (0-100): Clarity, urgency, market pain point validation
- Solution (0-100): Innovation, differentiation, feasibility, product-market fit
- Market (0-100): TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, growth potential, competitive landscape
- Traction (0-100): Revenue, users, growth rate, key metrics, customer validation
- Team (0-100): Relevant experience, domain expertise, execution capability
- Financials (0-100): Revenue model clarity, unit economics, projections realism

Be critical but constructive. Focus on actionable insights.
```

### 4. Gemini Processes (10-60 seconds)

Gemini Pro reads the ENTIRE pitch deck text and:
- Identifies the 6 key sections
- Scores each section 0-100
- Generates specific feedback
- Finds strengths and weaknesses
- Creates actionable recommendations

### 5. Response Parsing

```javascript
// Gemini returns text with JSON embedded
const response = await model.generateContent(prompt);
const text = response.text();

// Extract JSON from response
const jsonMatch = text.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/);
const aiResponse = JSON.parse(jsonMatch[0]);
```

### 6. Database Storage

```sql
-- Stores in deck_analysis table
INSERT INTO deck_analysis (
  deck_id,
  section_name,
  section_score,
  feedback,
  strengths,
  improvements
) VALUES (...);

-- Updates pitch_decks table
UPDATE pitch_decks 
SET analysis_status = 'completed', 
    sso_score = 0.83,
    analyzed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = deck_id;
```
