# 🔧 Database Connection Fix - RESOLVED

**Issue:** POST /api/decks/upload-dual returned 500 Internal Server Error  
**Root Cause:** Backend couldn't connect to database (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432)  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** (Revision 00006-8d5)

---

## 🐛 The Problem

### Error in Logs:
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
Database query error: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
```

### What Happened:
- Backend was trying to connect to localhost:5432 (doesn't exist in Cloud Run)
- Missing `NODE_ENV=production` environment variable
- Missing `CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME` environment variable
- Backend couldn't detect it's in production mode
- Fell back to localhost connection instead of Cloud SQL socket

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Added Environment Variables:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
DB_NAME=teamsso_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=160Im4xAykflQasNpgPv
CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=projectsso-473108:us-central1:team-sso-db
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAnWSc9H2ug4CIFKq9I-btv97hHBXAViSA
```

### Result:
```
✅ Connecting to Cloud SQL via socket: /cloudsql/projectsso-473108:us-central1:team-sso-db
✅ Environment: production
✅ All systems ready!
```

## 📊 What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Connect to 127.0.0.1:5432 | ✅ Connect via Cloud SQL socket |
| ❌ ECONNREFUSED error | ✅ Database connected |
| ❌ Upload fails (500) | ✅ Upload succeeds (201) |
| ❌ No NODE_ENV set | ✅ NODE_ENV=production |
| ❌ Missing Cloud SQL config | ✅ CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME set |

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Database Connection Logic:
```typescript
// In production (Cloud Run), use Unix socket for Cloud SQL
if (isProduction && cloudSqlConnection) {
  poolConfig.host = `/cloudsql/${cloudSqlConnection}`;
  console.log(`📡 Connecting to Cloud SQL via socket: ${poolConfig.host}`);
} else {
  // Local development
  poolConfig.host = process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost';
  poolConfig.port = parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432');
}
```

### Before Fix:
- `isProduction` = false (NODE_ENV not set)
- `cloudSqlConnection` = undefined
- Result: Connect to localhost:5432 ❌

### After Fix:
- `isProduction` = true (NODE_ENV=production)
- `cloudSqlConnection` = projectsso-473108:us-central1:team-sso-db
- Result: Connect via /cloudsql/... socket ✅
