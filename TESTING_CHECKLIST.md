# Quick Testing Checklist - Dual PDF Analysis

## ‚úÖ Pre-Testing Verification

- [x] Database migration applied to Cloud SQL
- [x] Backend deployed to Cloud Run (revision 00003-bm2)
- [x] Frontend code updated for dual PDF upload
- [x] Gemini 1.5 Pro Vision enabled in AI service
- [ ] Frontend dev server running on port 3001
- [ ] Sample pitch deck PDF prepared (with charts/graphs)
- [ ] Sample checklist PDF prepared (unit economics, growth metrics)

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Start Frontend (if not running)
```powershell
cd "d:\TeamSSO 2025\Team-SSO"
npm run dev
# Should open http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Navigate to Deck Intelligence
- Click "Deck Intelligence" in sidebar
- Should see dual upload interface

### 3. Upload Test Files
- [ ] Select company from dropdown
- [ ] Click "Choose Deck" ‚Üí select pitch deck PDF
- [ ] Verify green checkmark shows deck filename
- [ ] Click "Choose Checklist" ‚Üí select checklist PDF  
- [ ] Verify green checkmark shows checklist filename
- [ ] Click "Upload & Analyze Both Documents"

### 4. Monitor Upload
- [ ] Should see "Uploading..." state
- [ ] Then "AI analyzing visuals + checklist..." state
- [ ] Wait 10-30 seconds for analysis

### 5. Verify Results Display
- [ ] Overall SSO Score shown (0-10)
- [ ] Overall Score shown (0-100)
- [ ] Recommendation shown (INVEST/PASS/NEEDS_MORE_INFO)
- [ ] 6 section scores displayed
- [ ] Each section has feedback, strengths, improvements
- [ ] Checklist verification section visible
- [ ] Missing items listed (if any)
- [ ] Verified items listed
- [ ] Visual insights shown

## üîç What to Look For

### Pitch Deck Analysis Quality
- [ ] AI mentions specific charts/graphs from your deck
- [ ] Numerical data extracted from visuals (growth rates, revenue, etc.)
- [ ] Team composition insights if team slide has photos
- [ ] Market size numbers from TAM/SAM/SOM charts
- [ ] Financial projections referenced from projection charts

### Checklist Parsing Quality
- [ ] Unit economics items identified (CAC, LTV, etc.)
- [ ] Growth metrics items identified (MRR, ARR, etc.)
- [ ] Payment info items identified
- [ ] External links extracted (if any in checklist)
- [ ] Priorities assigned (critical/important/nice-to-have)

### Cross-Referencing Accuracy
- [ ] Items marked "verified" are actually in pitch deck
- [ ] Items marked "missing" are truly absent from deck
- [ ] No false positives (claiming something exists when it doesn't)
- [ ] No false negatives (missing something that's clearly there)

### Overall Decision Quality
- [ ] Recommendation matches the quality of your deck
- [ ] Strengths are specific and evidence-based
- [ ] Weaknesses are specific and actionable
- [ ] Key insights provide value beyond obvious observations

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch"
**Solution:** Check backend is running
```powershell
curl https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/health
# Should return {"status":"healthy"}
```

### Issue: "Both files required" error
**Solution:** Ensure you selected BOTH deck and checklist PDFs before clicking upload

### Issue: Analysis stays in "processing" forever
**Solution:** Check Cloud Run logs for errors
```powershell
gcloud run services logs read team-sso-backend --region=us-central1 --limit=50
```

### Issue: Visual analysis says "Visual analysis unavailable"
**Solution:** 
- Check if PDF has actual images/charts (not just text)
- Gemini Vision might have rate limits - wait a minute and retry
- Check Cloud Run logs for Gemini API errors

### Issue: Checklist parsing returns empty array
**Solution:**
- Verify checklist PDF has readable text (not scanned images)
- Check if checklist format is too unusual for AI to parse
- Review Cloud Run logs for parsing errors

### Issue: Low scores despite good deck
**Solution:** This is valuable feedback! The AI might be:
- Identifying genuine weaknesses you missed
- Looking for specific evidence (unit economics, metrics)
- Comparing against VC investment standards

## üîÑ If Testing Fails

1. **Check all services are running:**
   - Backend: `https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/health`
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3001`
   - Database: Cloud SQL `team-sso-db` instance running

2. **Review logs in order:**
   - Browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
   - Cloud Run logs (`gcloud run services logs read team-sso-backend`)
   - Cloud SQL logs (`gcloud sql operations list --instance=team-sso-db`)

3. **Verify environment variables:**
   ```powershell
   gcloud run services describe team-sso-backend --region=us-central1 --format="value(spec.template.spec.containers[0].env)"
   ```

4. **Test backend directly with curl:**
   ```powershell
   # Test companies endpoint
   curl https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/api/companies
   
   # Should return JSON with 5 companies
   ```
