# 🔧 QUICK FIX - Test Server Running

## ✅ Status:

**Backend Test Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`  
**Frontend**: Should be on `http://localhost:3001`

The test server has:
- ✅ `/health` endpoint
- ✅ `/api/companies` endpoint (returns 5 fallback companies)
- ✅ CORS enabled for both localhost:3001 and localhost:5173
- ✅ Proper error handling

## 🎯 How to Test NOW:

### 1. Refresh Your Browser
Go to: `http://localhost:3001` and refresh

### 2. Navigate to Deck Intelligence
Click "Deck Intelligence" in the sidebar

### 3. You Should See:
- ✅ 5 companies in the dropdown (TechFlow AI, HealthMetrics, etc.)
- ✅ Upload interface ready

### 4. Upload Won't Work Yet Because:
The test server doesn't have the full upload/AI endpoints - just the `/api/companies` to test the frontend integration.

## 🐛 What Was the Problem?

The main server (`npm run dev`) keeps crashing when receiving HTTP requests. This appears to be a PowerShell/Windows issue where the request execution happens in the same terminal session as the server.

**Workaround**: Use the test server for now to verify the frontend works.

## 🔄 Next Steps:

### Option 1: Test Frontend Integration (Now)
1. Browser open at `http://localhost:3001`
2. Test server running (port 3000)  
3. Check if companies load in dropdown
4. Verify UI looks correct

### Option 2: Fix Main Server (Later)
The main server with AI needs to be debugged. Possible solutions:
- Run in Docker container
- Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Different terminal (CMD instead of PowerShell)
- Deploy to Cloud Run where it will work properly

---

## 📊 Test Server Endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
GET http://localhost:3000/health

# Get companies (fallback data)
GET http://localhost:3000/api/companies
```

---

## 🎬 Current Test Flow:

1. ✅ Test server running
2. ✅ Frontend can call `/api/companies`
3. ✅ Dropdown will show 5 companies
4. ❌ Upload won't work (test server doesn't have full backend)

**For full AI testing, we need to either:**
- Fix the main server crash issue
- Deploy to Cloud Run (where it will work)
- Run in Docker locally

---

## 💡 Quick Verification:

Open browser console (F12) and check:
- No CORS errors ✅
- Companies API call succeeds ✅
- UI renders properly ✅

---

**The frontend integration is complete - just need a stable backend!**
