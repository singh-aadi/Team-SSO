## üß™ Testing Workflow in Postman

### Step 1: Health Check
1. Create new request in Postman
2. Set to `GET`
3. URL: `https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/health`
4. Click **Send**
5. ‚úÖ Should return 200 OK with `"status": "ok"`

### Step 2: Get Companies
1. Create new request
2. Set to `GET`
3. URL: `https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/api/companies`
4. Click **Send**
5. ‚úÖ Should return 200 OK with array of 5 companies
6. üìù **Copy a `company_id`** for next step (e.g., `41a84a5a-8647-4211-b568-8a36a82a27e8`)

### Step 3: Upload Dual PDFs ‚≠ê MAIN TEST
1. Create new request
2. Set to `POST`
3. URL: `https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/api/decks/upload-dual`
4. Go to **Body** tab
5. Select **form-data** radio button
6. Add these 4 rows:
   
   | Key | Type | Value |
   |-----|------|-------|
   | deck | File | [Browse and select your pitch deck PDF] |
   | checklist | File | [Browse and select your checklist PDF] |
   | company_id | Text | 41a84a5a-8647-4211-b568-8a36a82a27e8 |
   | uploaded_by | Text | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 |

7. Click **Send**
8. ‚úÖ Should return 201 Created with deck object
9. üìù **Copy the `deck.id`** from response

### Step 4: Monitor Analysis (Poll for Completion)
1. Create new request
2. Set to `GET`
3. URL: `https://team-sso-backend-520480129735.us-central1.run.app/api/decks/[PASTE_DECK_ID_HERE]`
4. Click **Send**
5. Check `analysis_status`:
   - `pending` ‚Üí Analysis hasn't started yet (wait 2-3 seconds, try again)
   - `processing` ‚Üí AI is analyzing (wait 10-20 seconds, try again)
   - `completed` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Analysis done! See full results in response
   - `failed` ‚Üí ‚ùå Analysis failed (check backend logs)

### Step 5: View Complete Analysis
Once status is `completed`, the GET request from Step 4 will return:
- Overall scores for 6 sections
- Checklist verification (what's missing/verified)
- Visual insights from charts/graphs
- Investment recommendation (INVEST/PASS/NEEDS_MORE_INFO)
- Detailed feedback for each section

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Both pitch deck and checklist PDFs are required"
**Fix:** Make sure you selected **File** type (not Text) for both `deck` and `checklist` in form-data body.

### Error: "invalid input syntax for type uuid"
**Fix:** Use valid UUID format for `company_id` and `uploaded_by`. Get company UUIDs from `/api/companies` endpoint.

### Error: "Failed to upload files"
**Fix:** 
- Ensure files are actual PDFs (not images or other formats)
- Check file size is under 15MB per file
- Verify backend is running: Test `/health` endpoint first

### Analysis Status Stuck on "pending" or "processing"
**Fix:**
- Wait at least 30 seconds for Gemini AI analysis
- Check backend logs: `gcloud run services logs read team-sso-backend --region=us-central1 --limit=30`
- If stuck for >60 seconds, analysis may have failed (check logs)

### CORS Errors in Postman
**Fix:** CORS shouldn't affect Postman (only browsers). If you see CORS errors, you're using Postman web version. Use Postman desktop app instead.
